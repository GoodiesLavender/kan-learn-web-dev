        <h2>A couple on a road Trip</h2>
        <p style="color: #777">
          Road Trip! It's always been my favorite. I always get excited to go on
          a road trip. Moreover, road trips help open up my mind. My favorite
          one was from Phoenix, AZ to Death Valley,CA. The fun thing about road
          trip is you will never know what a surprise will you get along the
          road. For insance, after driving for several miles my tire might
          decide to quit or an unexpected beautiful view, you will never know.
          Here is a link for more information about road trips.

          Cooking is one of my hobby lists that helps me de-stress, concentrate
          and stay focused on a recipe. It is the way to stay relaxed after all.
          I like all types of cuisine such as Mexican food, Thai food, Italian,
          and Mediterranean food. Each cuisine has amazing key ingredients and I
          have my favorite dish for each cuisine. For instance, I like Pozole in
          Mexican cuisine, Boat Noodle in Thai Food and Mushroom Risotto in
          Italian cuisine. Below is a recipe that I frequently use for my
          cooking.

        <h2>Travelling With Kid On Road Trip </h2>
        <p style="color: #777">
          Kid Activity! Long weekends come across. I always have this thought in
          my mind, how am I going to get my kid busy with, today. Some weekends
          we drive around in town but after a while the kid gets super bored.
          Art and craft are also good ones that keep them occupied. My kid likes
          to tie dye shirts. She also loves to put together pieces of feather
          and all kinds of material on paper and create artwork. Later on, art
          has become my hobby activity that I enjoy doing with my kid. We bond
          together while participating in the activity. We spend a valuable time
          creating artwork. I found myself interested in Acrylic painting and it
          is a really fun activity. Here is a free art class provided by
          Michaels store, check out the stores nearby.<br />
